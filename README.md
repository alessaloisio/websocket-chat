      - index.js => is the entrypoint for the Front-End (react.js)
      - App.js => the main component of your application
 
## Installation
1. First thing you have to do, is to clone this repo
2. You have to install dependencies for the two parts, 
so '*npm install*' on **ROOT DIRECTORY** AND on **client**
